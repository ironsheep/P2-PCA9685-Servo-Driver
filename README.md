# P2-PCA9685-Servo-Driver

Parallax Propeller V2 Interface object for the I2C 16-chan Servo Driver with demo of 6-Axis arm control

The goal of this project is to produce a P2 Obex object for control of 16-channels of PWM via I2C.

(while the Servos can be controlled directly from the P2, this demonstrates an alternative using fewer wires to control up to 16 servos for a couple of bucks more.)

The demo for this project is some quick software I whipped up to control a 6-axis arm which I'm using to position a motion sensor while i'm developing the motion sensor driver logic.  (This gives me highly repeatable positional testing of the sensor and is frankly quite fun.  *I dreamed of doing this back when I was testing an Apple Watch app that I was building to detect human falls.*)

And as I started in on this I also decided to use JonnyMac's FlySky SBUS support to also control the arm...


**Latest Repo Updates**:

20 Jul 2021 16:16
- Moved to separate COG control of servo-slew for smooth arm movements
06 Jul 2021 17:52
- First working flysky positioning of arm so we can setup positions and get servo values
28 Jun 2021 
- Servo slewing is working well
14 Jun 2021 14:45
- Arm is starting to position nicely... now planning needed positions...
06 Jun 2021 17:35
- Just wiring up the hardware so we can develop this driver. 
- Seeding our code base with various starter objects
```

## Current status

I'm working on position placement using FlySky then getting servo position readouts when I get to a desired ARM configuration.  Figuring out the puposes of the FlySky controls for this use case is proving to be quite interesting...

## Up Next

- Work our way up from the hardware to the arm control to the scripting of the arm
